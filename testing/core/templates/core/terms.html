      <p>
        Welcome to the <strong>Personal Financial Manager (PFM)</strong> application.
        By accessing or using this platform, you agree to comply with the following Terms & Conditions.
        Please read them carefully before continuing.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The PFM application helps users manage and analyze personal finances by tracking income,
        expenses, budgets, savings, and investments. It is intended solely as a financial
        management tool and does not provide professional financial or investment advice.
      </p>

      <h3>2. User Responsibilities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure that all information entered (income, expenses, and investments) is accurate and up to date.</li>
        <li>Keep your login credentials confidential and secure at all times.</li>
        <li>Use the system only for lawful, personal, and non-commercial purposes.</li>
        <li>Refrain from attempting unauthorized access or actions that could disrupt system performance or compromise other users’ data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Data Privacy and Security</h3>
      <p>
        All user data is protected through Django’s built-in authentication and encryption mechanisms.
        Personal and financial details are used solely within the application and are not shared with
        third parties without explicit consent. While we take appropriate security measures, no digital
        system can guarantee complete protection against unauthorized access.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Accuracy of Information</h3>
      <p>
        Financial reports and insights generated by the system are based on user-provided data and
        internal algorithms. These insights are for informational purposes only and should not be
        treated as financial advice. Users are responsible for verifying data accuracy and results.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Limitations of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        The PFM team and its developers are not liable for any financial losses, inaccuracies, or
        decisions resulting from the use of this system. The application is provided on an “as is”
        basis without warranties of any kind regarding accuracy, performance, or suitability.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Service Availability</h3>
      <p>
        We strive to maintain uninterrupted access to the application. However, temporary downtime
        may occur due to maintenance, updates, or technical issues. We are not responsible for
        losses resulting from service interruptions.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Modifications and Updates</h3>
      <p>
        We may modify these Terms & Conditions or update features periodically. Any significant
        changes will be communicated within the application. Continued use after updates implies
        acceptance of the revised terms.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Termination of Access</h3>
      <p>
        The PFM administrators reserve the right to suspend or terminate user access for violating
        these terms or engaging in unauthorized activity.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Intellectual Property</h3>
      <p>
        All application content, including code, design, and visuals, is the intellectual property
        of the PFM development team. Users may not copy, modify, or redistribute any part of the
        platform without prior written consent.
      </p>

      <h3>10. Governing Law</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms & Conditions are governed by the laws of <strong>India</strong>. Any disputes
        arising from the use of this application will fall under the jurisdiction of courts in
        <strong>India</strong>.
